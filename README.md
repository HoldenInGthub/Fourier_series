# Fourier_series
Fourier series matlab code for periodic signal

The file example.m teaches you how to use the function convolution_withcoordinates.m quickly.

The file fourier_series.m is the main function to calculate the fourier series.
Other files are the functions needed by the main function.

I hope this Matlab code is helpful to your learn.
